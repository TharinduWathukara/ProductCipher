Life is beautiful but not always easy, it h
as problems, too, and the challenge lies in faci
ng them with courage, letting the beauty of life
 act like a balm, which makes the pain bearable, 

during trying times, by providing hope


Happiness, sorrow, victory, defeat, day-night are

 the two sides of the me coin. Similarly life is full o
f moments of joy, pleasure, success and comfort punctuate
d by misery, defeat, failures and problems. There is no h
uman being on Earth, strong, powerful, wise or rich, who h
as not experienced, struggle, suffering or failure.
